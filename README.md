# Parametric_Speaker
This project is a simple parametric speaker design with a 64 transducer array and drive circuit.  The drive circuit is just a 555 that is modulated with an audio signal.  It also contains a filter and audio amplifier.  It is normally run into a PA amplifier to give the transducers a higher voltage, but all this could be integrated into one unit.
